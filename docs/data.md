# Data models

Use the following data models to add new columns to your tasks and forms lists. You can find the files for these data models in **/src/models/**.

For more information on adding new columns, see [Add and remove columns](./columnsAddRemove.md).

For more information on where to find the column definitions and where to cuztomize your columns, see [Customizing your columns](./customize.md).

_Note:_ These data models are based on the repository code's inbuilt calls to the [Nintex Automation Cloud API](https://developer.nintex.com).
You can retrieve more or different data by customizing these calls or creating your own.
